export const INTERESTS_READING = [
  "üìñ Reading: I was introduced to English literature in my college years and it soon became my favorite, go-to hobby. It was the tools of literary analyses that changed my interaction of books from consumption to engagement. Fiction specially contributes to most of my reading interest and experience because it represents artistic expression to me, both in terms of words and ideas. There's a very popular quote that readers live several lives and I stand by it. Books share different textures of human experience and philosophical enrichment - something which every adulting individual needs often to keep going. They are a perfect source of intellectual stimulation. I like to think of themes, ideologies, narrative instrumentation and novelty that all good books bring to some degree. If you are a productivity nerd, books are perfect ways to maintain your concentration and focusing muscle that help you excel in various tasks. Also, for non-native English speakers like me, books are all about learning how to communicate ideas and concepts effectively. Good books will always fascinate and satisfy you by being able to connect you intellect with the author's, even if you differ in ideas or background. And they are so entertaining and engaging. I could keep going on why books are so important to grow one's individuality while giving those anchor points of human experience that make us feel part of our world and existential condition.",

export const INTERESTS_PHOTOGRAPHY = [
  "üì∑ Photography: Another art form that I really appreciate due to its accessibility and universality, thanks to tech putting really good cameras on every person's hands. I am far from a seasoned or technically proficient photographer, but I try to observe art and aesthetics in good photos. I love to capture visual textures in my photography - textures that make up the variety of life around you without us realizing their contribution in creating the familiar, everyday, visually rich environment around us. It's not been long since I've gotten my own beginner DSLR and I have not been using it¬†that much (without regrets TBH). Because I also stand-by this popular quote that *'the best camera is the one you have with you'*.",

export const INTERESTS_ART = [
  "üñºÔ∏è Art: Similar to books, my actual mind-opening experience for art came through introductory courses in college. It unlocked (to aptly use John Berger's famous work on understanding art) *\"the ways of seeing\"* for me - what to see in art, what is art trying to do, and what to value in art. These are essential engaging tools to find a footing on the constantly changing realm of art. And why have art at all? For me, art is all about challenging the conventions of seeing and materializing that new, fresh, weird vision of the artist in creative ways, that has as much purpose in its form as much in its ideas. Art gives courage to view the society, world around you and your own existence differently. It is about expressing one's perception of beauty or tension or other spectrum of emotions for that existential release. And as a result of that expression, sharing those characteristics of human condition or existence that connect us despite hundreds of our differences and personal choices. It's a comfort for soul, while sometimes being uncomfortable to eyes or our conventions.",
  "  To quote from 'Dead Poets Society' about the reason to keep doing art - *\"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.\"*",

export const INTERESTS_MUSIC = [
  "üéº Music: If I were to define my taste in music in word, it will be *\"eclectic\"*. It consists of a spectrum of genres from your classic rock from 1970s, to earworm pop music topping the charts and trending on TikTok right now; from over-used, elevator-music classical symphonies to modern, offbeat, upcoming indie pop, folk and rock; from casually discovered music featured in popular TV shows and movies to underrated and often overlooked background scores of music. I definitely follow and curate popular music/genre from different eras. Does it make it *\"pop\"* essentially? [insert thinking philosophoraptor meme] Shout-out to classical and indie pieces that I often coming back to as your favourite, comfortable armchair at home. Jazz is probably my least favourite genre - simply because it is too improvisational for me. I will definitely not know the entire lyrics of most/many songs that I listen the most. I definitely do not worship any genre in particular with reverence and hold it high above others. I however like collecting music and growing my library. And on shuffle, always!",

  "Then comes the miscellaneous hobbies that I am trying to cultivate and mature into habit.",
  "üé≤ Board games - love how it is both entertaining and a wholesome opportunity to be competitive, creative and connecting. Boardgames (shout-out to Board Games Arena!) was a major blessing to compensate for the utter lack of socialization and peer-based entertainment during the never-ending-seeming social isolation phase of COVID 2019. I was grateful that I had the privilege and safety of finding a board-gamer entourage who grew closer with our almost daily sessions. Learned over 50+ different board games that I didn't know before. Had team-based tournament series within our group. *\"7 Wonders\"* stood-out as my favourite indulgence from that time.",
  "üí™Ô∏è Strength training for fitness - a nice balance to sweat out those active calories, keep your body sustainable with muscle+bone development and exercise the keep-pushing-on attitude.",
  "üçπ Mixology - another casual foray into crafting mocktails (no alcohol) and seeing the match-made-in-heaven combinations that can be created with balance of various taste profiles. It's a lazier version of cooking hobby because both the pre-work and post-work is much less with mocktail making compared to cooking/baking, while giving creative freedom to experiment with complexity and novel flavours that most people don't experience often. Plus, it's cool and fancy looking!",
  "ü™¥ Gardening - it's a new activity for me; perfect for intentionally slowing yourself down and activate your nuturing side. Philosophically, a very apt metaphor of consistently working on every thing you care about, every day, to see its growth and development over time.",
  "‚ôü Chess - the most recent addition. Disclaimer that I don't play it anywhere as good as I would consider \"good\" - I am only a beginner with below-average ELO at best. I have only started playing it recently, studying it from random sources and practice. I really enjoy watching chess games and analyses.",
